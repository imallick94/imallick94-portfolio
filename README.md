This is Ipsita Mallick's public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, Fall 2020 class at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
Hello! I’m Ipsita (she/her) and I’m a graduate student at the Integrated Innovation Institute, currently in my last semester of pursuing my masters in innovation for products and services (MIIPS Program) at Carnegie Mellon University. Over the summer I worked with a startup based in Berkeley, Climate Action Guide and with CMU’s Open Learning Initiative as a product design intern. Before joining grad school, I worked as an architect in Mumbai, India for the construction of two hospitality projects. I am now in the process of pivoting my career towards product design and UX. After graduating this December, I want to work on designing useful, usable and desirable products with a focus on inclusive user experiences for interactive/responsive environments, XR and IoT product-service ecosystems. 

# What I hope to learn
Over the course of this class, I want to learn to better visualize and communicate information revealed by data to ensure that decisions made in the process of product development and design are guided by an informed narrative which can have a powerful impact and solve challenges or problems for users in an informed and equitable manner. By understanding and communicating the story that historic or past data tells us, we can better identify the points of intervention for design and gain insights to drive us towards a more human-centred approach in thinking about better possible futures.

Quotes that inspire me:

“The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.” – Carly Fiorina, former executive, president, and chair of Hewlett-Packard Co.

"Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights." - David McCandless, author of book Information is Beautiful.
