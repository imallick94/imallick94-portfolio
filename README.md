This is Ipsita Mallick's public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data, Fall 2020 class at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
Hello! I’m Ipsita (she/her) and I’m a graduate student at the Integrated Innovation Institute, currently in my last semester of pursuing my masters in innovation for products and services (MIIPS Program) at Carnegie Mellon University. Over the summer I worked with a startup based in Berkeley, Climate Action Guide and with CMU’s Open Learning Initiative as a product design intern. Before joining grad school, I worked as an architect in Mumbai, India for the construction of two hospitality projects. I am now in the process of pivoting my career towards product design and UX. After graduating this December, I want to work on designing useful, usable and desirable products with a focus on inclusive user experiences for interactive/responsive environments, XR and IoT product-service ecosystems. 

# What I hope to learn
Over the course of this class, I want to learn to better visualize and communicate information revealed by data to ensure that decisions made in the process of product development and design are guided by an informed narrative which can have a powerful impact and solve challenges or problems for users in an informed and equitable manner. By understanding and communicating the story that historic or past data tells us, we can better identify the points of intervention for design and gain insights to drive us towards a more human-centred approach in thinking about better possible futures.

Quotes that inspire me:

“The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.” – Carly Fiorina, former executive, president, and chair of Hewlett-Packard Co.

"Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights." - David McCandless, author of book Information is Beautiful.

## Assignment 2 (09/16/20): OECD Government Debts

### Chart 0: Original Visualization

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/65K0" width="950" height="713" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/65K0" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2016</a></iframe>

### Chart 1: Using Flourish to visualize the data

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3758496" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3758496/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### Chart 2: Using Flourish to visualize the same data in an alternate way

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/3758613" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3758613/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### Comparing Charts 1 & 2
Chart 1 and chart 2, when visualized as above tell different stories while using the same dataset. While Chart 1 shows the timeline of government debts for OECD countries over time, chart 2 tells the story of government debts for OECD countries where only a handful of countries form the majority of government debts in total. Chart 1 is better if we want to tell the story of the trajectories of the government debts by country, and though one can see the countries with the highest levels of debts, it is made clearer through the treemap chart 2 through the hierarchy of the area of occupied by each country which can be seen all at one or by year using the filter function of chart 2.
