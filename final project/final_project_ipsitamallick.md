## The Problem: Access to menstrual hygiene for girls in India is a problem, but are current solutions enough?

Lack of access to menstrual hygiene products negatively impacts the education of millions of girls in India and a lot is being done to tackle this problem including national awareness campaigns, health and hygiene drives by NGO's as well as rural distribution of low-cost menstrual hygiene products. But are these solutions are sustainable and really effective? Or do they fail to tackle the real challenges that still exist below the surface? Let's look at Geeta's story to dig deeper.

## The Problem

(Detailed problem description)


## Meet Geeta!

(context & character intro + situation of problem with respect to her)

## What is being done about improving access to menstrual hygiene?

(solution & Geeta's journey/reaction)


## The issue at hand is more complex than you think.

(complexity aspects - cultural issues, access to proper toilets, waste generation and sustainability)


## Why awareness programs and distribution drives are simply not enough.

(Show Geeta's perspective)


## There is still work to be done.

(potential areas that need work - large scale)


## How can YOU create an impact?

(insert call to action here)


## The Data

I found a lot of journal and news articles, government reports and research papers on the topic for access to menstrual hygiene, but not many public datasets that I can use directly (nothing on Kaggle and Datahub) except for on the website of government of India National Family Health Survey which did not have datasets, but some fact sheets available. I found couple of data visualization stories on Tableau Public and I can use those sources, wherever provided by authors, to obtain datasets. Overall, I know data will be available on the topic to accessibility to menstrual hygiene products, but probably not so easily for the impact and effectiveness of current action taken or problems still persisting in terms of menstrual hygiene due to reasons and factors outside of accessibility and awareness such as social taboos, culture od gender discrimination, traditions and cultural beliefs, availability of public toilets for girls and the condition of sanitation facilities in rural parts of the country, etc.

Here are a few examples of datasets and reference article and research papers that I plan to use as sources for the data:

## Method & Medium

I plan to use Shorthand as the medium for presentation of the story, since it offers a lot of flexibility to add images, embedded visualizations and UI animations. I also want to consider Squarespace, since all my other portfolio projects are on my website, but it does not offer as much flexibility as shorthand to construct the structure and customise the template in terms of design.

For the data visualizations, I would like to primarily use Tableau (and maybe Flourish if necessary to achieve a specific effect/design I can't manage to get from Tableau). I would like to create some colour palettes on Adobe and coolors.co to ensure there is legibility through sufficient contrast ratios and easy to view for people with colour blindness. I would also use some photosop or illustrator to create my fictional story protagonist, Geeta as well as consistent background themes for shorthand.

Since my topic has relevance for an international audience, I'm considering ways to make the visualisations and text descriptions available in different languages besides English, such as Hindi (priority), French, Spanish, Chinese etc, but I'm not sure how I could implement this even if I were to use the HTML translate attribute by Google.

## Wireframes



## User Research

### Summarizing story in a sentence: 
"Lack of access to menstrual hygiene impacts the education of millions of girls in India."

### Target Audience: 
Users of Social Media who do not have much awareness or knowledge about the state of menstrual hygiene management in India or who don’t know how they can help.

### User perspective: 
"As a user of social media, I want to be motivated to be a part of the movement to improve the accessibility of menstrual hygiene in India so that I can make a positive impact at an individual level."

### Call to action: 
"I can do this by donating to and/or sharing information about an active crowdfunding initiative to help young girls in the remote town of Kargil, Ladakh access safe menstrual hygiene."

### Call to Action Goal: 
Get visitors to donate to a crowdfunding initiative for spreading safe menstrual hygiene education awareness to young girls in Kargil, India.

### Approach to identify individuals to interview:
My assumption is that a lot of people know about the problem and either do not know how they can help or what they can do about it at an individual level. Therefore, by providing the link to a crowdfunding initiative which is currently active as a call to action, I want to find out out of the 3 users I interview, how compelled do they feel to make a small donation to the initiative or share the story of such an initiative with others through their instagram stories to encourage more donations through wider outreach. Thus, from my social media account on instagram, I have identified 3 random acquaintances who are based in India to go through the story wireframes and assess their reaction to the story, their feedback and their motivation to be a part of the change.

### Interview Script

“Hi, my name is Ipsita and I’m a current graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. As part of a project that I’m working on, I have created this set of wireframes for telling the story of access to safe menstrual hygiene practices in India. Would you have 10 minutes to go through my sketches and answer 5 questions I have to get your feedback? The entire process should take about 10-15 minutes at most.”

**Questions**
- What are your initial thoughts on this?
- How effective were the visual representations in changing your perspective on what the problem is and how you as an individual can help?
- What did you think of the fictional character Geeta?
- Was there anything about the story you did not understand or find confusing?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Did you feel compelled enough to make a contribution to this initiative? If no, why?
