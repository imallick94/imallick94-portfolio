## The Problem: Access to menstrual hygiene for girls in India is a problem, but are current solutions enough?

Lack of access to menstrual hygiene products negatively impacts the education of millions of girls in India and a lot is being done to tackle this problem including national awareness campaigns, health and hygiene drives by NGO's as well as rural distribution of low-cost menstrual hygiene products. But are these solutions are sustainable and really effective? Or do they fail to tackle the real challenges that still exist below the surface? Let's look at Geeta's story to dig deeper.

## The Data

I found a lot of journal and news articles, government reports and research papers on the topic for access to menstrual hygiene, but not many public datasets that I can use directly (nothing on Kaggle and Datahub) except for on the website of government of India National Family Health Survey which did not have datasets, but some fact sheets available. I found couple of data visualization stories on Tableau Public and I can use those sources, wherever provided by authors, to obtain datasets. Overall, I know data will be available on the topic to accessibility to menstrual hygiene products, but probably not so easily for the impact and effectiveness of current action taken or problems still persisting in terms of menstrual hygiene due to reasons and factors outside of accessibility and awareness such as social taboos, culture od gender discrimination, traditions and cultural beliefs, availability of public toilets for girls and the condition of sanitation facilities in rural parts of the country, etc.

Here are a few examples of datasets and reference article and research papers that I plan to use as sources for the data:

## Method & Medium

I plan to use Shorthand as the medium for presentation of the story, since it offers a lot of flexibility to add images, embedded visualizations and UI animations. I also want to consider Squarespace, since all my other portfolio projects are on my website, but it does not offer as much flexibility as shorthand to construct the structure and customise the template in terms of design.

For the data visualizations, I would like to primarily use Tableau (and maybe Flourish if necessary to achieve a specific effect/design I can't manage to get from Tableau). I would like to create some colour palettes on Adobe and coolors.co to ensure there is legibility through sufficient contrast ratios and easy to view for people with colour blindness. I would also use some photosop or illustrator to create my fictional story protagonist, Geeta as well as consistent background themes for shorthand.

Since my topic has relevance for an international audience, I'm considering ways to make the visualisations and text descriptions available in different languages besides English, such as Hindi (priority), French, Spanish, Chinese etc, but I'm not sure how I could implement this even if I were to use the HTML translate attribute by Google.

## User Research


### Summarizing story in a sentence: 
"Lack of access to menstrual hygiene impacts the education of millions of girls in India."


### Target Audience: 
Users of Social Media who do not have much awareness or knowledge about the state of menstrual hygiene management in India or who don’t know how they can help.


### User perspective: 
"As a user of social media, I want to be motivated to be a part of the movement to improve the accessibility of menstrual hygiene in India so that I can make a positive impact at an individual level."


### Call to action: 
"I can do this by donating to and/or sharing information about [an active crowdfunding initiative to help young girls in the remote town of Kargil, Ladakh access safe menstrual hygiene](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/help-kargili-girls-be-safe)."


### Call to Action Goal: 
Get visitors to donate to a crowdfunding initiative for spreading safe menstrual hygiene education awareness to young girls in Kargil, India.


### Approach to identify individuals to interview:
My assumption is that a lot of people know about the problem and either do not know how they can help or what they can do about it at an individual level. Therefore, by providing the link to a crowdfunding initiative which is currently active as a call to action, I want to find out out of the 3 users I interview, how compelled do they feel to make a small donation to the initiative or share the story of such an initiative with others through their instagram stories to encourage more donations through wider outreach. Thus, from my social media account on instagram, I have identified 3 random acquaintances who are based in India to go through the story wireframes and assess their reaction to the story, their feedback and their motivation to be a part of the change.


### Interview Script

“Hi, my name is Ipsita and I’m a current graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. As part of a project that I’m working on, I have created this set of wireframes for telling the story of access to safe menstrual hygiene practices in India. Would you have 10 minutes to go through my sketches and answer 5 questions I have to get your feedback? The entire process should take about 10-15 minutes at most.”

**Questions**
- What are your initial thoughts on this?
- How effective were the visual representations in changing your perspective on what the problem is and how you as an individual can help?
- What did you think of the fictional character Geeta?
- Was there anything about the story you did not understand or find confusing?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Did you feel compelled enough to make a contribution to this initiative? If no, why?


### Findings from interviews:

#### Participant 1

What are your initial thoughts on this?

- *"This story gives me information about a problem that already exists but I'm glad it takes me on a journey to ultimately be part of a solution which is beyond just spreading awareness."*


How effective were the visual representations in changing your perspective on what the problem is and how you as an individual can help?

- *"The visualisation of geeta - and personalizing the idea of her by telling me she likes playing football, wants to be a doc, was feeling scared when she went to school that day- all of this helped me visualise and empathise with her far more effectively than I could have without the visuals."*


What did you think of the fictional character Geeta?

- *"A 13 year old girl with hopes and dreams. Could empathise with her troubles."*


Was there anything about the story you did not understand or find confusing?

- ***"Took me a second to get what you meant by MHM. Also, didn't quite understand what's the work being done to help girls in this space."***


Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- ***"Yes. Lose the acronyms. Tell me more about what is already happening in this space and what else we can do to help. Also, the link between why there's a gap, even when education and access interventions already taking place isn't clear."***


Did you feel compelled enough to make a contribution to this initiative? If no, why?

*"Definitely. Infact I was moved by the storyline and wanted to know how to help further. The story overall helps me understand the problem, tells me the size of the problem and also humanizes the impact. This makes me want to contribute and help out!"*



#### Participant 2

How effective were the visual representations in changing your perspective on what the problem is and how you as an individual can help?

- ***"The visuals helped me understand the problem, can be varied in terms on visualization, maybe? Also waste generated is because of inaccessibility to menstural hygiene or other wise?"***


What did you think of the fictional character Geeta?

- *"Quite informative character, covers most of the problems that girls face regarding mensturation."*


Was there anything about the story you did not understand or find confusing?

- ***"Nothing confusing but would like to know more about infrastructure initiatives to understand the impact of my contribution."***


Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- ***"There’s a break in the story when Geeta has been introduced. The information provided before Geeta’s story and after Geeta’s story somehow overlaps and could have been clubbed together. Infographics following Geeta’s story could be personalized to her problem, maybe like some of the misconceptions or like education outcome would be more relevant following Geeta’s story?"***

Did you feel compelled enough to make a contribution to this initiative? If no, why?

- ***"I felt compelled and would have shared the story on Insta (could also be because of intrinsic motivation and interest in the issue) How can I contribute in spreading awareness about healthy and affordable alternatives to current practices (dirt or cloth) would have spiked my interest more."***



#### Participant 3

What are your initial thoughts on this?

- *I think the story is clear. I saw 3 main aspects of menstrual hygiene management and a focus on a specific geographic region - India, which is clear and I like how it gives the big picture first and then gives the details on education, infrastructure and environmental concerns."*


How effective were the visual representations in changing your perspective on what the problem is and how you as an individual can help?

- *"The story is clear so it has an impact. **At some level I wanted the more variety in data visualization representation.*"


What did you think of the fictional character Geeta?

- ***"Its a good idea to have someone people can relate to - the personalisation aspect is good. But her individual problem was not touching upon on all 3 aspects of your problem, which are education, infrastructure, environmental concerns and cultural taboos. So it would be more effective if her story was more tied to the data being presented."***


Was there anything about the story you did not understand or find confusing?

- ***"The character introdutction/use case was not clear, I felt the story was focussing on one thing but the flow was broken by Geets - there is a break in the though process."***

Is there anything you would change or do differently?

- ***The initiatives being undertaken by the government - rethink why you are putting that slide. If it is only to show that a lot has been done by the government but it is not effective, think of a better way to show why they are failing rather than providing details of each initiative or campaign."***


Did you feel compelled enough to make a contribution to this initiative? If no, why?

- ***"I would definately visit the page to learn more about the details of the initiative. Maybe it would be effective to stress on the details of the initiative at the end of the story to actually show how much has been raised already and what is being done in terms of infrastructure building."***




## Changes I plan on implementing to address issues identified:

There are some patterns in the interview responses that I see (highlighted in bold). These are the changes I feel would be most necessary at this point:

- Provide more details on the call to action, since the story aims to compel viewers to share and make a contribution through crowdfunding. Showing the gap between how much has been collected and how much remains will also add to the urgency of the need.
- Disconnect between goverment initiatives and why they are ineffective due to character introduction, rethink the structure of sections.
- Improve the details of problems faced by Geeta at an individual level so that it can be tied to the data visualizations rather than have the two sections separate.
- How is the waste and disposal issue relevant to improving access to menstrual hygiene - needs to be tied in together.




# Part 3

Here is a link to the [Final Data Story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/access-to-safe-menstrual-hygiene-is-a-problem-in-india-/index.html#article)

## Intended Audience

For this story, my intended audience was social media users who would want to know about the issue and share the story on social media for a wider outreach that compels people to make a contribution to the call-to-action initiative. I knew I would share this story with users who are mostly in the US (which is a diverse and international community) or in India and I realized that english would be a good language choice to communicate the story to this audience. I wanted the story to be told in very simple language, not too text-heavy, but enough to provide information and details wherever necessary such that even if someone is scrolling down quickly, and not reading details, they still get a jist overall of what the story is talking about through the simple, consistent visuals and bold/highlighted text. 

One strategy for creating engagement was to start the story with some minimal information and hard-hitting stats which encourages people to scroll more and find out more. I wanted the fictional character to be very personable so that users could empathize easily as well. So writing her dreams and the sad aspect of her having to drop out of school was important.


## Process of creating the final data story page


### Revising Wireframes based on feedback

Based on user feedback, there were 3 main things I needed to rethink:
- story structure: problem statement -(transition)- complexity of problem -(transition)- impacts -(transition)- call-to-action.
- tie in character's story with the problem
- details on call-to-action

I decided to start with some facts, to give an overview of the the seriousness of the problem, then provide further details on the complexity of the story through the perspective of the fictional character. In this section instead of providing the full story of the character at one go, I decided to break it down and provide numbers or stats alongside the narrative or journey of the character.
(Note: I changed the character's name to "Fatima" from "geeta" since the call-to-action was an initiative based in Kargil and most of the population there is Muslim, therefore I thought it would be more appropriate.)

I wireframed the information flow as below:

<img src="https://github.com/imallick94/imallick94-portfolio/blob/master/images/WF_A.png?raw=true" width="1000">
<img src="https://github.com/imallick94/imallick94-portfolio/blob/master/images/WF_B.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Once I knew how the data and information sequence, I started to create the data visualisations and work on shorthand simultaneously by creating the sections as I had wireframed.


### Creating visual styles & data visualizations

The first decision was the colour scheme. Red seemed like an appropriate colour, not only because the topic was access to menstrual hygiene, but also because it's a good colour to attract attention and highlight important parts in a visualization or in text. To complement and balance red, a neutral palette was black, shades of grey and white.

In terms of the typography, I wanted to create a clear hierarchy. Most important or hard-hitting information was in the heading text on shorthand and details in paragraph font. Since this topic is a serious one, I chose Lato, which is legible and not too overwhelming, minimal and report-like.

For the data visualisations, I decided to primarily use Flourish, as I could quickly chose a template and edit it with my data. 

Most of my data could be presented in simple bar charts or donuts since they were single percentages. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-election" data-src="visualisation/4025010" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4025010/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4027614" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4027614/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4029480" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4029480/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Note: Wherever the stats could be written as a simple sentence, I did not feel the need to add a graph and instead highlight or bold the stat or number. This also reduces an effect of information overload.


For the urban-rural gap chart, I wanted to visually highlight a "gap" or show distance between urban and rural stats in the access to menstrual hygiene. I could have gone with a grouped bar chart here, but a visualization I did before to show gender gap was effective so I decided to stick to a similar format for the current dataset.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/4023914" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4023914/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


For the correlation between education and access to menstrual hygiene, I wanted a very simple and clear representation so that viewers can understand it in a glance. Personally, I find scatter plots difficult to understand correlation, but a double-sided bar chart seemed simple enough for people to read quickly. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4024619" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4024619/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


I kept images to a minimum, only applying them where necessary to reduce cognitive load and move the focus to the data visualizations. Fatima could have been an animated character, but I wanted her to seem as real as possible to create an impact on the viewer, as if she could be a young girl the viewer would know. So I chose an image of a rural girl from India. On shorthand, I decided to add an effect of going from colour to desaturation (or vice versa) in these images to  create a feeling of emotional transition from positive to negative or vice versa for the viewer as they scroll.

Providing the images of the call-to-action initiative added details of the action being taken on the ground as well as make it feel more credible or real for the viewers.
